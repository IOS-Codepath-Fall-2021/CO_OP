## Overview
### Description
Nutrionapp is a nutrition app that assists people in pursuing a healthy and nutrient balanced lifestyle. The app is powered by the Nutritionix Database that has data on over 1 million data points on common foods, grocery and restaurant items. The app can suggest, track, customize a healthy diet for you ensuring each one of your users to be as healthy as possible. The app can also suggest the most cost efficient location to purchase these items.  
### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle/ Diet/ Health
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile versions could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Gather general health status and analyze users' food choices, to suggest a diet plan that helps users to balance nutrients, and reach their goals. This app will coach and support the user in this diet process.
- **Market:** Any individual of any age group could choose to use this app as this app does not have access accounts nor store any user information; This makes our app very secure and accessible. This app will also consider all users' culture foods as well truly being inclusive to all populations.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or often as the user wanted depending on their own will and perseverance on a healthy life. It's also what exactly the user is  looking to improve in their diet and health.
- **Scope:** First we would start with just suggesting basic diet plans to users, then perhaps this could evolve into an individual diet/health coach that is tailor made for all users, as this progresses we broaden the apps usage and funcatilties. Eventually the application will have a large potential for use and be supported with apple health or samsung health.
